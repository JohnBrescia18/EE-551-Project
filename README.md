This is my EE551 python individual project | Author: John Brescia

Objective:
The object of this code is to create a two player snake game. Both players would play on the same keyboard and would battle agaisnt each other in order to be the last snake standing

Features:
- 1 or 2 players be able to play 
- Allow players to name their snake and have their snakes name displayed at the top of the screen next to where there score woulld be placed.

- Library for potential use: Pygame

- After each game, the start menu would pop back up allowing you to switch the gamemode(1 or 2 players).

TODO:
- Create a grid for the playing field (very large so there is plenty of room and so the game feels less choppy)
- Create different base values for different key components such as (empty space, food, snakes head, snakes body)
- Create functions to make the snakes body and snakes head interact with one another (the snakes body follows the head)
- establish movement using wasd for single player and wasd and the arrow keys for two player.
- Create interaction bettween components such as increasing the snakes size by one when the snake eats the food and also ending the game when a snake crosses paths with its own body or the other players body

Add Ons(Extras I can do If I have extra Time):
- Being able to change the snakes color at the startup menu for easier eye tracking for the player
- Different Types of food such as a bigger food such 
  - Bigger food (+ 2 snake bodies), Spoiled Food(-1 snake body)
