- Multiple types of food to eat: snacks, meals, poison, boosts

- After each game, the start menu would pop back up allowing you to play again.

Gam:
- Create a grid for the playing field (very large so there is plenty of room and so the game feels less choppy)
- Create different base values for different key components such as (empty space, food, snakes head, snakes body)
- Create functions to make the snakes body and snakes head interact with one another (the snakes body follows the head)
- establish movement using wasd for single player and wasd and the arrow keys for two player.
- Create interaction bettween components such as increasing the snakes size by one when the snake eats the food and also ending the game when a snake crosses paths with its own body or the other players body

Add Ons(Extras I can do If I have extra Time):
- Being able to change the snakes color at the startup menu for easier eye tracking for the player
